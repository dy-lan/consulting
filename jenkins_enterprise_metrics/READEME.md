A client needed a solution that returned the total number of Jenkins jobs in their private instance and the number of active jobs. Active jobs were deemed active if they had been ran since an arbitrary date (listed in the scripts). There are three slightly different scripts that all accomplish the same thing. There were lots of jobs in the Jenkins instance, so I wrote the solution in three slightly different ways to see if one in particular had better benchmarks.
